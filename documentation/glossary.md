# Glossary

:::{glossary}

Fornax Science Console
: NASA-funded web-based application that provides access to cloud computing via {term}`JupyterLab`.
  See {ref}`intro-forsc`.

Fornax Science Console Dashboard
: Webpage where users can start a Fornax Science Console session, find links to documentation, and view compute and storage resource consumption.
  See {ref}`forsc-dashboard`.

Fornax Community Forum
: Community space that includes a help desk and user discussion areas.
  See {ref}`intro-forum`.

CPU
: Central processing unit. Hardware on a {term}`server <server>` that executes code or other instructions.

Egress
: Moving data from a cloud environment to a different location.
  This includes downloading data from the Fornax Science Console.

Environment
: Self-contained collection of software (interpreter, libraries, packages, and settings) installed together so that code execution is reproducible and isolated from other setups.
  In practice, an environment lets you pin specific package versions (e.g., Astropy, NumPy) without affecting the base system or other projects.

Jupyter Console
: Interface that combines aspects of {term}`terminals <terminal>` and {term}`notebooks <Jupyter Notebook>`.
  Useful for users who prefer to work in a terminal but also want the graphical output that is possible in a notebook (e.g., when plotting with `matplotlib`).
  See [Jupyter User Interfaces](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/user-interfaces.html).

Jupyter Notebook
: Document that combines live-code with narrative text, equations and visualizations.
  See [Jupyter User Interfaces](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/user-interfaces.html).

JupyterLab
: Advanced web-based application that the Fornax Science Console is built on.
  See [Jupyter User Interfaces](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/user-interfaces.html).

Kernel
: Computational engine that executes your code and sends results back to the Jupyter frontend.
  Each kernel is tied to a particular {term}`environment <environment>` and handles code execution, introspection, and communication with the notebook UI.
  See [Jupyter: Kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html#kernels).

RAM
: Random-access memory. Hardware on a {term}`server <server>` that holds information in memory.

Server
: Computer hardware on which a Fornax Science Console session is run.
  In the context of the Fornax Science Console, a server is roughly analogous to a personal computer.

S3
: Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).
  Cloud-based object storage analogous to a file system.
  See [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Terminal
: Interface that allows users to interact with the system by entering text commands.
  The "terminal" is also known as the "command line".
