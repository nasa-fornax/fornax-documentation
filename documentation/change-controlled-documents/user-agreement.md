# Fornax User Agreement

V.1.1 January 26, 2026

The Fornax Team is excited to welcome you to the Fornax Science Console. Please be aware that as a Fornax user you will receive the following resources and need to obey the following guidelines:

1. **NASA will provide you with a certain amount of cloud resource “credits”** that can be spent on compute, storage, and egress. (See [User Resource Allotments and Costs for Beta Users v1.1](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/user-resource-allotments-and-costs)).

   1. **In** **the cloud, every second that compute, storage, or egress is in use will cost credits.** This is substantially different from traditional on-premises hardware costs.

      1. For more information, see the User Resource Allotments, above, and [Fornax Resources and Best Practices](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/intro-forsc/#intro-best-practices) in the Fornax docs.

   2. **Be advised that Fornax is not a super-computing center**, however the resources available, when used wisely, can produce substantial results.

   3. **If you run out of credits, you may temporarily be limited in compute and storage until you receive more credits.**

      1. Information on automatic credit renewal is in the User Resource Allotments, above. If you need more credits before the scheduled renewal, please contact the [Fornax Helpdesk](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/fornax-community-forum/#helpdesk).

2. **The Fornax Science Console is for scientific research and education only**.  Anyone found using it for other purposes may have their account instantly revoked.

3. **Please behave professionally when interacting with other users and Fornax staff.** See the [Code of Conduct \- Fornax Community Forum](https://discourse.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/guidelines) for more info.

4. **The** [NASA Web Privacy Policy](https://www.nasa.gov/privacy/) **pertains to the Fornax Science Console.**

5. **Failure to follow Fornax guidelines may result in termination of your account.**

6. **If you have questions**:

   1. For users who don’t have a Fornax Account, send e-mail to: [fornax-helpdesk@lists.nasa.gov](mailto:fornax-helpdesk@lists.nasa.gov)

   2. For users who have a Fornax Account, use the [Fornax Helpdesk](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/fornax-community-forum/#helpdesk)
