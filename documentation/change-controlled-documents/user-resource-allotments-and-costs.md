# Fornax User Resource Allotments and Costs

V.1.1  January 26, 2026

Upon your first login to the Fornax Science Console you will have:

**1000 credits** for spending on cloud resources (compute, storage, and egress); this is renewed yearly, at the beginning of the fiscal year (Oct. 1). If you need more credits before the renewal date, contact the [Fornax Helpdesk](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/fornax-community-forum/#helpdesk).

**A 200 GB ceiling** to the private storage available in your Home Directory; if your work requires more, please contact the [Fornax Helpdesk](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/fornax-community-forum/#helpdesk).

**Access to additional, private S3 storage**, mounted as “s3-storage” under your Home Directory, for a cheaper storage option (see table, below)

The [Fornax Science Console Dashboard](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/dashboard/) will help you keep track of what you have spent.

**For more information**, see: [Fornax Resources and Best Practices](https://docs.fornax.sciencecloud.nasa.gov/intro-forsc/#intro-best-practices) in the Fornax docs
