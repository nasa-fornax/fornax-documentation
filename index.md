[The Fornax Initiative](https://pcos.gsfc.nasa.gov/Fornax/) is NASA Astrophysics' cloud-based system that brings together data, software, and computing so that researchers can focus on science.

Fornax is a modern, cloud-native platform for reproducible astronomy, purpose-built to support scientific discovery in the era of petascale data.
It is developed through a collaboration between NASAâ€™s science archives; HEASARC, IRSA, and MAST; to transform how astronomers interact with large-scale datasets.

Designed to transform how astronomers interact with large-scale datasets, Fornax addresses four key goals:

 *  providing robust computing resources,
 *  broadening scientific opportunity through enhanced access and reproducibility,
 *  delivering targeted training on data-intensive astronomical research,
 *  co-locating compute power with the data itself to enable efficient, cloud-native workflows.

To achieve these goals, the Fornax project comprises three integrated components.
First is the science console itself, a scalable, cloud-based research environment grounded in open-source tools and infrastructure.
Second is a curated ecosystem of interactive notebooks and containerized mission and community software tailored for multi-wavelength and big-data science.

Finally, Fornax offers a suite of advanced NAVO-based data services designed to support rapid, location-independent access to distributed datasets across the NASA archives and beyond.
